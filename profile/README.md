## Hi there 👋

Launch Platform is a startup focusing on building innovative, high-quality software. The core values of our company:

- 🎉 Have fun - Innovation is challenging, but at least we hope to have some fun, enjoy the process, embrace failures and learn.
- ➖ Less is more - Making things complex is easy. Making things simple is hard, and that's what we aim for.
- 🍵 Slow down, so it's faster - To move faster in the long run, we prefer to slow down and take time to make things right.
- 💡 Work smart - There's always a better way to do it. Always think about working smarter.
- 🙈 Privacy matters - Customer privacy matters to us, the only product we sell is the product, and it's only for serving our customers.
- 🎁 Open source - We build most of our software upon open-source software. We love open-source and would like to give back as much as possible.

Currently, we have three main SaaS products:

- [Monoline](https://monoline.io/) - Write down your thought freely and quickly, and sync automatically across devices on different platforms in real-time. Put it simply, it's a messenger app but only for sending to yourself.
- [BeanHub](https://beanhub.io) - BeanHub is a modern accounting book service based on the most popular open source version control system Git and text-based double-entry accounting book software Beancount.
- [PolisNetwork](https://polisnetwork.io) - A self-serving advertisement solution for converting your website traffic into sales.

We also offer one-stop, end-to-end software development services to help businesses stay competitive.
